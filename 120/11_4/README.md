# 2D Vectors 

This repository contains a simple C++ testing suite for working with **`std::vector`**. 
## Instructions

1. Download the project files:

   ```bash
   mkdir 2d && cd 2d && curl --remote-name-all https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jjoeldaniel/si/main/120/11_4/{main.cpp,run.sh,README.md} 
   ```

2. Complete the TODOs:

3. Run the testing suite script:

   > Note: You will only have to run `chmod +x run.sh` once!

   ```bash
   chmod +x run.sh
   ./run.sh
   ```

This script will compile the `main.cpp` file using either `clang++` or `g++` (depending on availability). If compilation is successful, it will run the testing suite to verify the functionality.

4. Review the test results:

   After running the script, you will see the output of the testing suite.
