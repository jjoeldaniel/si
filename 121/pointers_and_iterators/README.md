# Smart Pointers Iterators 

This repository contains a simple C++ testing suite for working with **smart pointers** and **iterators**.
## Instructions

1. Download the project files:

   ```bash
   mkdir pointers_and_iterators && cd pointers_and_iterators && curl --remote-name-all https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jjoeldaniel/si/main/121/pointers_and_iterators/{main.cpp,run.sh} 
   ```

2. Complete the TODOs:

3. Run the testing suite script:

   > Note: You will only have to run `chmod +x run.sh` once!

   ```bash
   chmod +x run.sh
   ./run.sh
   ```

This script will compile the `main.cpp` file using either `clang++` or `g++` (depending on availability). If compilation is successful, it will run the testing suite to verify the functionality.

4. Review the test results:

   After running the script, you will see the output of the testing suite.
